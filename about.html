        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">About Bumi Reflesia</h1>
        <p class="text-center mb-5">Raflesia Restaurant was established in 2025 as an expression of love for Bengkulu's rich culinary heritage. The name Raflesia was inspired by the Rafflesia arnoldii flower, the largest flower in the world and an icon of Bengkulu Province. The restaurant was founded based on the founder's desire to preserve family recipes that had been passed down from generation to generation. Many of Bengkulu's signature dishes are becoming increasingly rare, so the restaurant is committed to making them more widely known and loved again, especially by the younger generation.</p>
